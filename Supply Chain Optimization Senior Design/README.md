DESCRIPTION

           This project was a year long project which consisted of a five person team.  In this real world project we worked directly with the University of Cincinatti Medical Center, to solve a current day issue in the medical field, effecient patient care.  In the medical field millions of dollars are lost annually do to poor scheduling of medical rooms, specifically surgical rooms.  This causes issues with the processing, caring of, and discharge of patients.  The help mitigate this issue hospitals tend to expand their facilities, which ultimately, creates a larger bottle neck.  To prevent this we suggested a better scheduling system which is much more effecient.  Using research we found from Harvard University we created an optimization program for hospital scheduling.  

         Our main goal for this project was to use stochiastic modeling to create an optimized scheduling system to solve this probel.  Our one limitation we set our self was to minimize the effecincy of the program to minimize computational resources needed,  We decided we would make sure this program would run on a standard stock computer instead of a cluster system which most hospitals use.  With this we created a MATLAB program which ran the optimization of the schedule, a LAMP somputer system to store the data and be the hardware for the MATLAB program to run on, and a simple IOS app to display the info.
