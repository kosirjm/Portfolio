# VERILOG (DIGITAL SYSTEM DESIGN)
-------------------

DESCRIPTION
-------------------
This project was created for my Digital System Design class.  In this class we used Altera DE2 boards to practice many different aspects of digital design such as FSMs, combination logic, arithmetic operations, and more.  Using Quartus we programmed our FPGA board to talk to an encryptor FPGA board (created by our professor).  Our system would receive a message which needed to be deciphered.  We had to then create a way to visualize the data.  In this case we used a VGA screen plugged into the FPGA.  Then we had to create a way to interact with the system to enter the deciphered code back to the encryptor FPGA.  In our case we created a system that used a PS2 keyboard connected to the FPGA.  More in depth detail of the project will be included in the zip with the Verilog files.  This project was done many years ago and has no demonstration video for it, and it is not possible to create one This is due to the lack of access to a FPGA and the code used for the encryptor FPGA.?

KNOWLEDGE GAINED
--------------------
* An understanding of the basic building blocks of digital systems
* How to build combinational and sequential systems and analyze their timing behavior and cost
* The ability to evaluate the pros and cons of using different types of design technology
* The ability to use different CAD tools and HDL to create combinational and sequential circuits
* How to test and debug these systems

FILES
--------------------
Disclaimer:  These files were done for a course that was taken.  Some files may be poorly commented, not completely working, or could be made much more robust and user friendly.  This is due to either time constraints or simply lack of knowledge of the subject at time of creation.  At some point I may go back and fix up everything, but for now this is here to provide an idea of thought process and an idea of general ability in this subject matter.
