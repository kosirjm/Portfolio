# JAVA PROGRAMMING (COLLECTION OF JAVA PROGRAMS)
---------------------

DESCRIPTION
---------------------
The below programs are a collection of all my Java programs created over the past years.  It shows the ability to program robust software using object oriented techniques such as inheritance, polymorphism, and composition.  It also shows the ability to create programs which contain recursion, exception handling, file IO, and GUIs.   The network, client/server, side of programming was also touched upon using Java as a programming language.  The programs below also show knowledge with in this area.  Different types of data communication and network based software are demonstrated. 

KNOWLEDGE GAINED
----------------------
* How to write robust programs using object oriented techniques
* How to write and read basic UML class diagrams
* How to use permanent storage to preserve a program
* How to read and write recursive algorithms
* The ability to describe and use sorting algorithms appropriately
* The understanding of computer network and non-trivial multithreading as well as the ability to code them
* A better understanding of different network terminology and different types of networks
* How networks work, the different protocols associated with them, and the rules they follow.  Some concepts include TCP/IP network functions, and protocols such as DNS, HTTP, and ARP
* With this, the ability to program these protocols.
* The relationship between a network program and its host
* Common security vulnerabilities, the ramifications they have, and how to avoid them
* How to program multi-threaded client/server network programs
