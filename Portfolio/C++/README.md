
# C++ (DATA STRUCTURES)
---------------------

DESCRIPTION
---------------------
The following programs are various self programmed data structures.  This allowed me to understand better the implementation of these abstract data types, as well as explore my ability to better use object-oriented programming.  Non-linear, sequential, and linked storage representations are shown.  Through all this a better ability to analyze and select the correct ADT implementation for a set project was gained.  
         
KNOWLEDGE GAINED
---------------------
* How to determine and select the appropriate data structures, abstract data types, and algorithmic method for a certain problem
* The ability to determine the time and space requirements of these data structures and algorithms
* How to implement data structures and abstract data types using object oriented programming
