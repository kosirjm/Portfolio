03_Queue_Lab
============

Implement an array-based queue in C++

Note: When you create your project, do NOT add ArrayQueue.ipp to the list of source files, add it to the list of include files. You will see that ArrayQueue.ipp is #included at the bottom of ArrayQueue.h. See ArrayQueue.h for more explanation.

Requirements
------------

1. remove takes O(1) time
2. add takes O(1) time, unless it calls grow (in that case O(n) is okay)
3. grow is only called if the number of items == backingArraySize, and the size of the array is doubled during grow
4. grow takes O(n) time
5. Do not leak memory (make sure grow and the destructor do the right thing)
6. getNumItems is O(1) time
7. add and remove throw excpetions as appropriate
8. You must use the array in a circular fashion. If you don't do this you probably won't be able to get #1, #2 and #3 to all be true.

Questions
=========

#### 1. Which of the above requirements work, and which do not? For each requirement, write a brief response.

1. Works, it should only take 0(1) to remove an item
2. Works, it should only take 0(1) to add an item unless there is not enough space.  Then you must grow the array and it will take 0(n)
3. Works, it takes a new array and makes its size double the old one.  Then it adds the items from the old array to the new one.
4. Works, it only takes 0(n);
5. Works, needed to make sure in the destructor to call delete[] also on backingArray before reinitializing it.
6. Works, it is one simple call.
7. Works, they throw exceptions according to when the instructions asks to throw.
8. Works as well.

#### 2. If we did a Stack instead of a Queue, which of the private methods and variables would we need to keep, and which could we get rid of? Explain your answer.  
Since stack knows its size you can get rid of the backingArraySize.
#### 3. What is one question that confused you about this exercise or one piece of advice you would share with students next semester? 
None I think overall this was a pretty good lab to get the hang of how Queues work using modulus.
#### 4. In Java you might write "class ArrayQueue extends Queue" ... how do you write the same thing in C++?
<tt> class ArrayQueue : public Queue {}; </tt>
[Fixed for portfolio]
#### 5. What is the purpose of "templates" in C++? 
It is basically the equivalent of an abstract class in java.  It initializes some of the variables and methods for a class.  Also it allows you to use any data types instead of one specific one.

#### 6. What would the syntax be for dynamically allocating an array of 10 ints, in C++?
<tt> int* something = new int[10]; </tt>
#### 7. What is the purpose of a class destructor in C++? Why don't you need them in Java?
You need to do this in C++ and not java because Java does it for you automatically.  It must be done so the allocated memory is cleared when you donâ€™t need it any more, otherwise it may cause a memory leak.
