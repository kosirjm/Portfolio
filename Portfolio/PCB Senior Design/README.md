# PCB DEVELOPMENT (SENIOR CAPSTONE PROJECT)
-------------------

DESCRIPTION
-------------------
This project was a semester long project in which me and another teammate, with the aid of a professor, learned how to run the engineering school's new PCB (prototype circuit board) machine.  With this we learned many different skill sets and was given an opportunity many other students were not.  We were able to learn all the steps and processes of creating a PCB from the very beginning to the very end.  We worked with different software and machines for testing.  This includes software such as eagle and ISOPRO and hardware such as voltmeters, the printer, and oscilloscopes.  I was even given the opportunity to create my own circuit data analysis test software/ hardware using an Arduino.  With the new machine there were many issues which had to debugged and solved.  We did a lot of problem solving and actually ended up working directly with the PCB printer’s company to debug and solve issues with their hardware and software (ISOPRO).  Our senior design project went so well our professor asked me to continue to help him in running and fixing the PCB machine the following semester. 

KNOWLEDGE GAINED
--------------------
* Research and design of hardware to meet design needs (Voltage Amplifier)
* Data analysis and testing of created hardware to meet specific needs
	* PCB Design process
	* Using Eagle to design PCB?
	* Using Eagle to convert files to needed type for PCB printing
	* Using ISOPRO to finish design and print PCB
	* Soldering Components
* How to use, teach, debug, and document a PCB printer (One of three people in the engineering department who ?knew how to use machine)
