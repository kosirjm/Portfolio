DESCRIPTION

            This project was the first project I worked on in the engineering department at Miami University.  We were tasked with designing a robot that hung from a track.  This hanging robot would move along this track and would differentiate between blocks placed along the path.  Then the robot would do different task such as knock the block down, or make a noise.  This was my first introduction to design processes and programming, as well as working in a team to complete a given task.  Sadly, there is not available video for this project in action, it has been lost to the sands of time.
