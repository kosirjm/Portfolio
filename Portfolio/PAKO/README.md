# PAKO INC. (INTERNSHIP) FILE SHARING WEBSITE
----------------------

DESCRIPTION
----------------------

While working at PAKO INC.  I was tasked many different jobs and responsibilities.  The biggest project I encountered while working at this company was a file sharing website.  I was given the responsibility of creating a file sharing website for PAKO Inc.’s employees and clients to upload and download proprietary blueprints and other work files.  Previously the sending of files could be a long and tedious task.  Since PAKO Inc. had proprietary and government contracts simply emailing the files was not an option due to strict protocol and regulation.  Therefor this website was created.

For this project I was the only team member.  I researched, presented, developed, and trained people on this website.  To start this project, I had no other previous knowledge of website development, just some intermediate level programming abilities.  I taught myself basic php, javascript, html, mysql, css, and other needed topics.  After trial and error and much research a framework to work around was decided on, Ajaxplorer.  Once this decision was made a WAMP setup was installed on our server.  I set up and installed the needed modules and applications onto the server.  Once this was done I began development.  Many things changed and were added as the process went on.  I continuously presented my work and listened to feedback from my supervisors, which included head of IT, the company CEO, the company owner and many more.  With this I accepted the feedback and fixed the issues or added the features which were desired.  Though in some circumstances because of time constraints and feasibility certain features were not in the realm of possibility and I had to explain why these ideas could not be included at the time. 

When the product was up and functioning the website had to be audited and inspected for security purposes.  Once the website got the okay and was approved I presented and trained the appropriate people in the use of the application.  I documented and created many step-by-step documents for users and admins.  I also fixed bugs and continued to add functionality to the site while in use.  Some features of the site include:
* Watermarking files on upload
* Deleting files after set time on site
* Deleting files after completed download
* Email notifications to the correct people for certain actions such as upload download or other various file operations
* Secure login with captcha
* Different directories and permissions for each user
