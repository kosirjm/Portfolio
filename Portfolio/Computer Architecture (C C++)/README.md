
# COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE (C/C++)
------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
The programs below show a fairly comprehensive understanding of computer architecture.  The ability to understand different principles behind the design and implementation of operating systems, and the understanding of an OS as a resource manager.  With this many topics were learnt and listed below:
* Command languages and user interface. 
* Process scheduling and deadlock prevention. 
* Memory management, virtual memory, paging, and segmentation. 
* Interrupt processing. 
* Device management, I/O systems and I/O processing. 
* Security and protection.
* User interface programming in current operating systems.    
        
KNOWLEDGE GAINED
------------------------------
* The organization of operating systems
* CPU scheduling and how to coordinate concurrent processes
* Memory management 
* How to use and create file systems and how to manage secondary storage
* The detection, avoidance, prevention, and recovery of deadlocks
* The design and development of operating systems.
