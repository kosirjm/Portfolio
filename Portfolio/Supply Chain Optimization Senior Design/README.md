# SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT (SENIOR CAPSTONE PROJECT)
-----------------------

DESCRIPTION
-----------------------
This project was a year long project which consisted of a five person team.  In this real world project we worked directly with the University of Cincinnati Medical Center to solve a current day issue in the medical field, efficient patient care.  In the medical field millions of dollars are lost annually do to poor scheduling of medical rooms, specifically surgical rooms.  This causes issues with the processing, caring of, and discharge of patients.  The help mitigate this issue hospitals tend to expand their facilities, which ultimately, creates a larger bottle neck.  To prevent this we suggested a better scheduling system which is much more efficient.  

Our main goal for this project was to use stochastic modeling to create an optimized scheduling system to solve this problem.  Our one limitation we set ourselves was to maximize the efficiency of the program and to minimize computational resources needed.  We decided we would make sure this program would run on a standard desktop computer instead of a cluster system which most hospitals use.  With this we created a MATLAB program which ran the optimization of the schedule, a LAMP computer system to store the data and be the system for the MATLAB program to run on, and a simple IOS app to display the info.
