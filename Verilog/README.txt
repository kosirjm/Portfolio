DESCRIPTION

           This project was created for my Digital System Design class.  In this class we used Altera DE2  boards to use many different aspects of digital design such as FSMs, combination logic, arithmetic operations and more.  Using Quartus we programmed our FPGA board to talk to an encryptor FPGA board (created by our professor).  Our system would receive a message which needed to be deciphered.  We had to create a way to visualize the data, in this case we used a VGA screen plugged into the FPGA.  Then we had to create a way to interact with the system to enter the deciphered code back to the encryptor FPGA.  In our case we created a system that used a PS2 keyboard connected to the FPGA.  These two tasks put together was very time consuming, and a bit extensive.  More in dept detail of the project will be included in the zip with the Verilog files.  This project was done many years ago and has no demonstration video for it, and it is not possible to create one.​

FILES

  Disclaimer:  These files were done for a course that was taken.  Some files may be poorly commented, not completely working. or made much more robust and user friendly.  This is due to either time constraints or simply lack of knowledge of the subject at time of creation.  At some point I may go back and fix up everything, but for now this is here to provide an idea of thought process and an idea of general ability in this subject matter.
