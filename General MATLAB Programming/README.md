DESCRIPTION

           This section will show my knowledge of MATLAB programming from an engineering perspective.  In here it will show my knowledge and ability to use the language from image processing to embedded system design and beyond.  Down below there will be a few videos to demonstrate a few programs I have created, in a couple of different design areas.  Then in the files section I will have all my MATLAB programs from this course for download.

FILES

            Disclaimer:  These files were done for a course that was taken.  Some files may be poorly commented, not completely working. or made much more robust and user friendly.  This is due to either time constraints or simply lack of knowledge of the subject at time of creation.  At some point I may go back and fix up everything, but for now this is here to provide an idea of thought process and an idea of general ability in this subject matter.
