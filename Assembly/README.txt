	This section shows the knowledge of basic Assembly.  With this, learning basic assembly instructions, how to write and assembly program, and how a high-level language is translated into assembly was learned.  Each file was written in MIPS and used the MARS compiler.  Below is a quick video demonstrates of each program and all programs can be downloaded from below.
Hello World
This is a simple hello world program in assembly. 	
Multiples 
This is a simple assembly program which multiples two numbers which are given by user input.  With each iteration of the loop the number is printed out until the completion of the multiplication. 

Greater Than
This assembly program takes in two inputs from the user and returns the one which is greater than the other.

Atoi1
This is a simple program which turns a entered string into an integer.

Palindrome
This program takes a string inputted by a user and lets you know if it is a palindrome or n

FILES
Here are the files for the above programs.  Some of the code must be updated and lack the necessary comments.
